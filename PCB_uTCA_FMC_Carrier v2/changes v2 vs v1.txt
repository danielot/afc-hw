 1 ####
 1.8V LED does not work - transistor added.


 2 ####
moved FLASH to the other side of the PCB - FMC collision


 5  ###
 AMC TRST - pullup instead of pull down

 6  ###
R262, R263 changed to 453R  to ensure VADJ range of 1.8 to 3.3V

7  ###
R131 -> 4k7


8  ###
Added I2C switch between P3V3 and P3V3_MP supply domains so the clock IC does not block the I2C bus of the MMC CPU

added BOOT CLK input on AE5 pin, connected to the 20MHz oscillator

 9  ###
LDy shifted 5mm from panel lightguide

 10 ###
correct marking (0r/dnp) of resistors in WR clocking circuit

11 ###
  added testpoints to some free FPGA pins


12 ###
added option of using Fat Pipe 2 GTP ports as PORT0,1,2 and 3

13 ###
fixed FPGA reset - it is issued by MMC now after configuration is done.


 14 ###
 DDR memory chips spread apart to fit 4Gbit dices in 12mm packages


 15 ###
SN65MLVD040, PDn pin -> P3V3


 16 ###
added UFL clk input and CLK output

17####
 removed MMC usb, added FPGA vUART
